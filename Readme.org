This library contains miscellaneous macros that I use in my projects, or that I thought might be useful.

* Examples
Prompt the user for a free keybinding:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (untilnext (read-key-sequence "Enter a key: ")
            (read-key-sequence "That key is already bound to a command. Try again: ")
            (lambda (x) (not (key-binding x))))
#+END_SRC
 Keep a track of the number of prompts
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (untilnext (read-number "What is 1+1? Attempt 1: ")
            (prog1 (read-number  (concat "Wrong! Try again. Attempt " (number-to-string num) ": "))
              (setq num (1+ num)))
            (lambda (x) (= x 2))
            (num 1))
#+END_SRC
