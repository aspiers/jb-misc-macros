;;; Commentary: 
;;
;; Bitcoin donations gratefully accepted: 
;;
;; How to create documentation and distribute package:
;;
;;     1) Remember to add ;;;###autoload magic cookies if possible
;;     2) Generate a bitcoin address for donations with shell command: bitcoin getaccountaddress jb-misc-macros
;;        and place address after "Commentary:" above.
;;     3) Use org-readme-top-header-to-readme to create initial Readme.org file.
;;     4) Use M-x auto-document to insert descriptions of commands and documents
;;     5) Create documentation in the Readme.org file:
;;        - Use org-mode features for structuring the data.
;;        - Divide the commands into different categories and create headings
;;          containing org lists of the commands in each category.
;;        - Create headings with any other extra information if needed (e.g. customization).
;;     6) In this buffer use org-readme-to-commentary to fill Commentary section with
;;        documentation from Readme.org file.
;;     7) Make any necessary adjustments to the documentation in this file (e.g. remove the installation
;;        and customization sections added in previous step since these should already be present).
;;     8) Use org-readme-marmalade-post and org-readme-convert-to-emacswiki to post
;;        the library on Marmalade and EmacsWiki respectively.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put jb-misc-macros.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'jb-misc-macros)

;;; Customize:
;;
;; To automatically insert descriptions of customizable variables defined in this buffer
;; place point at the beginning of the next line and do: M-x auto-document

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET jb-misc-macros RET
